### Lazy Rocketeer - LLM Agent to design rocket engines 

With this LLM Agent, I experiment with applying Agentic AI to a design process like making it to reason around system requirements and project parameters as well as to prepare design inputs and analyze design outputs.

You can communicate in natural language with the agent. To run: *** streamlit run app.py ***
